                        GrailPay™ originates from the inspiration of 16 year old founder William Messina to create
                        ways all people can benefit from greater efficiency in the way that retailers interact with
                        consumers. William has a passion for creating ways to better the world. He began developing
                        the concepts for GrailPay™ at the age of fourteen after discovering the amount of money that
                        retailers expend on customer acquisition and for payment of merchandise with credit cards.
                        These observations led to the development of the concept of creating efficiencies for the
                        retailer that would then fund loyalty rewards and enhance engagement between retailer and
                        customer. William has incredible passion for GrailPay™ and knows that it will become the next
                        generation of rewards payment.
